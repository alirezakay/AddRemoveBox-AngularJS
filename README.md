 I tried to implement this project with **AngularJS**, because of someone's question on stackoverflow: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45935946/add-remove-box-in-html-using-angularjs)
 
 <code>data-ng-repeat</code> is the main angularjs directive, needed to use into the html elements for adding or removing similar items hence you can add/remove an item from left box to the right box, or vice versa
 
 you can see the performed project in this link: https://alirezakay.github.io/projects/phase1/AddRemoveBox-AngularJS/
